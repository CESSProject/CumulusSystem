# Cumulus Encrypted Storage System（CESS）
## Introduce
CESS are the trailblazers of decentralized cloud storage infrastructure built upon the foundation of blockchain and cloud storage. Utilizing blockchain technology, CESS makes effective use of online idle storage resources to establish an infinite distributed storage network of low capacity data nodes. Simultaneously, with the help of virtualization technology and cloud computing technology, it implements effective management of these resources to reprocess then redistribute data and provide users with a secure and efficient data storage service. 

## Architecture 
CESS is a high-speed, secure, scalable and decentralized cloud storage system. It can handle tens of thousands of transactions per second through parallel technology. Through Data slicing technology, it can achieve the secure storage of massive data, and it has the functions of Data confirmation and Data rights protection, which provides powerful data service ability. It provides DAPP with unlimited scalable storage capacity and perfect Data rights protection capability.
The architecture of cess is shown in the figure 1, CESS adopts a layered and loosely coupled design method, which is divided into Blockchain service layer, distributed storage resource layer, Distributed content distribution layer and Application layer. Among them, Blockchain service layer provides blockchain service of the whole CESS network, including encouraging idle storage resources, computing resources to join CESS network to provides data transaction, data confirmation and other services for the application layer. the Distributed storage resource layer uses virtualization technology to realize the integration and pooling of storage resources. The infrastructure consists of storage capacity miners and storage scheduling miners. The distributed content distribution layer uses content caching technology to realize the fast push of stored data, which is composed of data index miner and data distribution miner. By API node of Application layer, CESS can realize data storage service, blockchain service to support enterprise level SDK, data storage network disk and computational intelligence applications, etc.
