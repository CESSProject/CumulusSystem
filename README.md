# Cumulus Encrypted Storage System（CESS）
CESS are the trailblazers of decentralized cloud storage infrastructure built upon the foundation of blockchain and cloud storage. Utilizing blockchain technology, CESS makes effective use of online idle storage resources to establish an infinite distributed storage network of low capacity data nodes. Simultaneously, with the help of virtualization technology and cloud computing technology, it implements effective management of these resources to reprocess then redistribute data and provide users with a secure and efficient data storage service.
